;; title: oracle
;; version: 1.0.0
;; summary: Oracle Contract for BitHedge platform
;; description: Provides reliable price data for Bitcoin and other assets to the BitHedge platform.

;; Implementation Status:
;; ---------------------
;; Phase 1 Completed:
;; - Fixed linter errors by replacing deprecated get-block-info? with burn-block-height
;; - Implemented burn-block-height for time-sensitive logic as per best practices
;; - Created foundation for provider submission retrieval with get-recent-provider-submissions
;; - Added minimum providers check in aggregation process
;; - Set up placeholder structure for calculating aggregated prices from multiple providers
;; - Implemented framework for marking submissions as used in aggregation
;;
;; Phase 2 Completed:
;; - Implemented robust consensus mechanism using weighted median based on provider weights
;; - Added support for multiple provider submissions in aggregation logic
;; - Improved timestamp calculation for aggregated data using median of submission timestamps
;; - Enhanced submission tracking to prevent reuse in multiple aggregation rounds
;; - Refactored update flow to emphasize aggregation over single-provider updates
;; - Fixed linter errors by replacing 'when' with proper 'if' statements
;; - Added deprecation notices to single-provider update functions
;;
;; Next Steps (Phase 3):
;; - Implement standard volatility calculation using standard deviation
;; - Add TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) calculations
;; - Add price change percentage calculations over specified timeframes
;; - Enhance robustness with additional error handling
;; - Fix remaining linter errors related to type consistency
;;
;; Known Issues:
;; - There's a persistent linter error in the mark-submissions-as-used function related to
;;   inconsistent return types. This needs resolution in a future update.
;;
;; Note: The current implementation now features a complete multi-provider
;; aggregation system using weighted median as the primary consensus mechanism.
;; Single-provider update functions (update-btc-price, update-asset-price) are 
;; now marked as deprecated and users should transition to the submit+aggregate pattern.
