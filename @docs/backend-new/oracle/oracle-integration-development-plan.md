**Phase 1 Notes & Commentary:**

- Tasks `OC-101` through `OC-105` were completed as planned, resulting in a simplified `oracle.clar` contract.
- **Trait Implementation (`PC-101`, `OC-106`) Aborted:** Significant challenges were encountered attempting to implement and integrate the `parameter-trait`. Persistent `unresolved contract` and `failed to parse type` errors arose within the Clarinet testing environment and linter, despite adhering to standard trait syntax. Extensive debugging (moving files, cache clearing, syntax checks, using `burn-block-height` vs `block-height`) did not resolve the root cause, potentially indicating a tooling issue. To avoid blocking progress, the decision was made to **hardcode validation parameters** directly into `oracle.clar`. The trait (`parameter-trait.clar`) and implementation (`parameter-oracle-impl.clar`) files were moved to `pending-contracts` for potential future revisiting. Tasks `PC-101` and `OC-106` are marked as Deferred (`âšª`).
- **Functional Testing & Fixes**: Debugging during Devnet deployment and UI testing revealed issues with timestamp handling (`ERR-INVALID-PARAMETERS` on submission) and timestamp interpretation in the frontend (`useLatestOraclePrice` hook). These were resolved by modifying `set-aggregated-price` to use `burn-block-height` internally and updating the frontend hook to correctly format the block height for display.

**Phase 1 Deliverables:**

- Refactored `oracle.clar` contract aligned with the simplified specification (with hardcoded parameters).
- ~~Defined Parameter Contract trait.~~ (Moved to `pending-contracts`)
- ~~Basic integration for reading parameters in `oracle.clar`.~~ (Removed due to hardcoding)
- Basic Convex function to read the latest price from the deployed contract. (BI-101 - Completed)
- Initial unit tests for `oracle.clar` (Passing with one known limitation).

### Phase 2: Convex Backend Implementation (Duration: Est. 5 days)

**Goal:** Build the core off-chain logic within Convex for data processing and serving the frontend.

Functionality exists within `convex/prices.ts`.
- **CVX-207** (Frontend Data Query): The existing `getLatestPrice` query provides the latest aggregated data. A new query, `getLatestSourcePrices`, was added to provide the breakdown of individual source data needed for the `PriceOracleNetwork.tsx` component.
- **CVX-208** (Submission Preparation): Implemented a new `prepareOracleSubmission` internal action in `convex/blockchainIntegration.ts` which formats the aggregated price for submission to the blockchain and calculates percent change to assist with threshold checks.
- **CVX-209** (Cron Job Scheduling): Added a cron job to `convex/crons.ts` to schedule the `prepareOracleSubmission` action every 5 minutes.
- **TEST-201** (Calculation Tests): Test file `convex/prices.test.ts` created. Tests for query functions (`calculate24hRange`, `calculateVolatilityWithTimeframe`) implemented. Tests for the `fetchPrices` action (aggregation/outlier filtering) require further investigation into mocking external calls (`axios`) and mutations within Convex testing framework and are pending.
- **TEST-202** (Frontend Query Tests): Implemented tests in `convex/prices.test.ts` for `getLatestPrice` and `getLatestSourcePrices` queries.

**Phase 2 Deliverables:**

- Functional off-chain price aggregation and validation in Convex.
- Off-chain calculation of volatility and range.
- Convex query ready to serve data to the frontend.
- Scheduled Convex action framework for initiating on-chain updates.
- Unit tests for Convex backend logic.

### Phase 3: Blockchain Integration & Connection (Duration: Est. 4 days)

**Goal:** Connect the Convex backend to the `oracle.clar` contract securely and implement update logic.

**Phase 3 Deliverables:**

- Secure mechanism for signing backend transactions within Convex.
- Functional Blockchain Integration layer for submitting prices to `oracle.clar`.
- Completed `submitAggregatedPriceToOracle` action with threshold checks and on-chain submission.
- Integration tests validating the backend-to-blockchain flow.

**Phase 3 Progress Notes (Updated: August 2024):**

The first three tasks of Phase 3 have been successfully completed:

1. **BI-301 (Environment Variable Setup):** Implemented the `getBackendSignerKey` function in `convex/blockchainIntegration.ts` to securely retrieve the Stacks private key from environment variables. This function includes error handling for missing configuration.

2. **BI-302 (Transaction Building):** Added two key configuration helpers:

   - `getStacksNetwork`: Dynamically determines the appropriate Stacks network (Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet) based on the `STACKS_NETWORK` environment variable.
   - `getOracleContractInfo`: Retrieves contract details from `ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `ORACLE_CONTRACT_NAME` environment variables.

   Also implemented the `buildSetPriceTransactionOptions` function which constructs the transaction options for `set-aggregated-price`, converting the price parameter to the expected Clarity Value format.

3. **BI-303 (Transaction Signing):** Created the `signSetPriceTransaction` internal action that:

   - Builds the transaction options using the previously implemented function
   - Retrieves the private key and derives the sender address
   - Fetches the current nonce from the Stacks API (with error handling for new accounts)
   - Assembles and signs the transaction using `makeContractCall` from the Stacks.js library

4. **CVX-301 (Threshold Check Logic - Implemented):** The `prepareOracleSubmission` action was refactored to implement multi-factor threshold checking. It now:

   - Fetches the latest aggregated price from the Convex DB (`api.prices.getLatestPrice` - Linter fix applied).
   - Fetches the last on-chain price using `api.blockchainIntegration.readLatestOraclePrice` - Linter fix applied).
   - Applies thresholds based on price change percentage, max/min time since last update, and minimum source count (using hardcoded values for MVP, defined in `ORACLE_UPDATE_THRESHOLDS`).
   - Returns a `shouldUpdate` flag and a reason.
   - ~~**Note:** There are remaining linter errors related to resolving `internal.prices.getLatestPrice` and `internal.blockchainIntegration.readLatestOraclePrice` within the `ctx.runQuery` calls. These appear to be type/reference resolution issues within the generated Convex API code and do not necessarily block functionality but should be investigated further for long-term stability.~~ (Linter errors resolved by using `api` reference).

5. **BI-304 (Transaction Broadcasting - Implemented):** Added the `broadcastSignedTransaction` internal action to `convex/blockchainIntegration.ts`. This action takes a signed transaction object and broadcasts it to the configured Stacks network using `broadcastTransaction` from `@stacks/transactions`. It includes basic error handling for broadcast failures and returns the `txid` on success. (Linter fix applied for function call).

6. **BI-305 (Submission Wrapper - Implemented):** Added the `submitAggregatedPrice` public action to `convex/blockchainIntegration.ts`. This action orchestrates the submission process by calling the internal `signSetPriceTransaction` and `broadcastSignedTransaction` actions. (Linter fixes applied for internal action calls).

7. **CVX-302 (Cron Job Integration - Implemented):** Created a new internal action `checkAndSubmitOraclePrice` in `convex/blockchainIntegration.ts`. This action calls `prepareOracleSubmission` to check thresholds and, if needed, calls `submitAggregatedPrice`. Updated `convex/crons.ts` to schedule `checkAndSubmitOraclePrice` every 5 minutes instead of directly scheduling `prepareOracleSubmission`.

8. **CVX-303 (Submission Recording - Implemented):** Defined a new table `oracleSubmissions` in `convex/schema.ts` to store details of submission attempts. Created the `recordOracleSubmission` internal mutation in `convex/blockchainIntegration.ts` to insert records into this table. Integrated the call to this mutation into `checkAndSubmitOraclePrice` to record successful submission attempts.

The remaining tasks for Phase 3 involve:

- ~~Implementing transaction broadcasting and confirmation handling (BI-304)~~ (Completed)
- ~~Creating a wrapper action for easier submission (BI-305)~~ (Completed)
- ~~Integrating these components (CVX-302)~~ (Completed)
- ~~Storing submission state (CVX-303)~~ (Completed)
- **Testing the complete flow (TEST-301)**

**Architectural Considerations & Future Improvements:**

During development review, several architectural concerns were identified that should be addressed in future iterations beyond the MVP:

1. **Error Resilience & Recovery:** Enhance error handling with retry mechanisms and exponential backoff for transient failures in API calls or network connectivity.

2. **Transaction Fee Management:** Implement dynamic fee calculation based on network conditions instead of relying on default fee estimation.

3. **Nonce Management:** Develop local nonce tracking for rapid consecutive transactions rather than fetching nonce for each transaction independently.

4. **Submission Threshold Logic (Priority):** We will implement a multi-factor threshold approach for CVX-301 that considers:

   - Percentage price change since last on-chain update
   - Time elapsed since last update (maximum update interval)
     For future versions, consider enhancing with:
   - Absolute price change relative to current price
   - Current market volatility
   - Gas costs relative to the importance of the update

5. **Transaction Monitoring:** Implement a tiered confirmation system for different confidence levels in transaction finality.

**Next Implementation Focus:**
Before proceeding with BI-304, we will prioritize implementing the multi-factor threshold logic (CVX-301) since this is critical for determining when price updates should occur.

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration & Testing (Duration: Est. 3 days)

**Goal:** Connect the UI to the backend and perform end-to-end testing.
