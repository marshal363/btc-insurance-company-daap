4. Integration (6) depends on completion of all implementation tasks (2, 3, 4, 5)
5. Security Auditing (7) depends on substantial completion of Integration (6)
6. Deployment (8) depends on successful completion of Security Auditing (7)

## Total Estimated Timeline: 41 weeks (approx. 10 months)

- Project Setup & Infrastructure: 2 weeks [PARTIALLY COMPLETED]
- Core Smart Contracts: 8 weeks [COMPLETED - Unit Testing IN PROGRESS]
- Supporting Smart Contracts: 6 weeks [PARTIALLY COMPLETED - 40%]
- Off-Chain Services: 10 weeks [NOT STARTED]
- Risk-Reward Tier System: 2 weeks [NOT STARTED]
- Integration and Testing: 6 weeks [NOT STARTED]
- Security Auditing and Optimization: 4 weeks [NOT STARTED]
- Documentation and Deployment: 3 weeks [NOT STARTED]

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Complexity:** Begin with proof-of-concept implementations for complex components
2. **Integration Challenges:** Implement continuous integration early in the process
3. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Conduct ongoing security reviews throughout development
4. **Timeline Overruns:** Include buffer time in estimates and identify parallel work streams
5. **Resource Constraints:** Identify critical path components and prioritize accordingly

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked against the eight major milestones, with regular status updates on:

- Tasks completed vs. planned
- Issues and blockers identified
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Adjustments to timeline or scope as needed

## Current Progress Summary (Updated)

- **Completed Tasks:** 34
- **In Progress Tasks:** 7
- **Next Task Focus:** Complete Liquidation Engine Contract (3.3)
- **Overall Project Completion:** ~30%

## Key Observations and Recommendations

1. Core smart contracts (Policy Registry, Liquidity Pool, Oracle, Parameter, Governance) are fully implemented but unit testing is still in progress.
2. Supporting contracts (Treasury and Insurance Fund) are also well-implemented but need unit testing.
3. The Liquidation Engine Contract should be the next focus area after completing unit tests.
4. Consider starting early planning for off-chain services while continuing work on remaining smart contracts.
