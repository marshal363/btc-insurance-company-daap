# BitHedge Protocol Asset Flow Analysis

## Executive Summary

This technical analysis examines how different assets (Bitcoin, sBTC, STX) flow through the BitHedge protocol ecosystem, specifically focusing on the economic mechanisms that ensure long-term sustainability. By mapping transaction flows, fee structures, collateralization requirements, and payout processes, we provide a detailed understanding of how BitHedge balances risk and incentives for all participants while maintaining protocol solvency and sustainability.

The analysis reveals that BitHedge employs a multi-asset approach leveraging the unique properties of native Bitcoin, synthetic Bitcoin (sBTC), and Stacks (STX) to create an economically sustainable options protocol. The hybrid implementation model establishes clear asset flow pathways that ensure protection sellers are properly incentivized, protection buyers receive reliable coverage, and the protocol itself generates sufficient revenue to maintain operations.

## Asset Roles in the BitHedge Ecosystem

Before analyzing flows, we must understand the distinct roles each asset plays:

| Asset                        | Primary Role                                 | Technical Implementation                    | User Experience                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Bitcoin (BTC)**            | Reference asset for protection policies      | Off-chain asset tracked via price oracles   | Protection buyers want to preserve BTC value    |
| **Synthetic Bitcoin (sBTC)** | Potential future collateral asset (post-MVP) | On-chain Stacks asset backed 1:1 by Bitcoin | Advanced collateral option in future versions   |
| **Stacks (STX)**             | Primary collateral and settlement token      | Native Stacks blockchain token              | Used for premiums, collateral, fees, settlement |

This asset architecture enables the core PUT option functionality in the MVP while laying groundwork for future expansion.

## MVP Scope and Design

The BitHedge MVP focuses specifically on providing PUT options (price protection) for Bitcoin holders with a streamlined design:

### MVP Core Design Principles

1. **Focused Functionality**:

   - Only PUT options are supported in the MVP
   - Protection buyers (Protective Peter) buy PUT options to hedge BTC downside risk
   - Protection sellers (Income Irene) sell PUT options to earn premium income

2. **Simplified Asset Model**:
   - STX is used exclusively as collateral for PUT options
   - STX is used exclusively for premium payment
   - STX is used exclusively for settlement payments
3. **Financial Rationale**:

   - STX as collateral/settlement currency preserves the buyer's BTC holdings
   - Buyer receives STX compensation for BTC value loss rather than having to sell BTC
   - This aligns with the primary use case: BTC holders wanting to protect value without selling

4. **Technical Simplicity**:
   - Single collateral type reduces complexity in MVP implementation
   - Eliminates need for complex risk adjustments for different collateral types
   - Provides clear user experience for both buyers and sellers

Future versions will expand beyond this MVP scope to include additional assets and option types.

## Comprehensive Asset Flow Analysis

### 1. Protection Purchase Flow (Buyer → Protocol → Seller)

When a protection buyer (Protective Peter) purchases a policy:

**Asset Flow:**

1. **Premium Payment:**
   - Buyer pays premium in STX
   - Premium is split into three components:
     - **Seller Portion (80-90%)**: Directed to protection seller (Income Irene)
     - **Protocol Fee (8-15%)**: Retained by protocol treasury
     - **Network Fee (2-5%)**: Covers transaction costs on Stacks blockchain

**Implementation Details:**

- All premium transactions are executed on the Stacks blockchain
- Premiums are denominated in STX but calculated based on BTC value and volatility
- For direct peer-to-peer transactions, premium flows directly from buyer to seller, minus protocol fees
- For pool-based transactions, premium flows to the liquidity pool contract

### 2. Collateralization Flow (Seller → Protocol)

Protection sellers must fully collateralize their protection offerings:

**Asset Flow:**

1. **Collateral Deposit:**

   - For the MVP, sellers deposit STX as collateral into the protection contract
   - Collateral amount must cover the full potential payout value of the PUT option
   - STX is used exclusively for PUT option collateral in the MVP phase

2. **Collateral Locking:**
   - Deposited collateral is locked for the duration of the protection policy
   - Locked collateral earns no additional yield while committed (yield is from premium income)
   - Collateral cannot be withdrawn until policy expires or is settled

**Implementation Details:**

- In the P2P model: Each protection seller's collateral is individually tracked and locked
- In the Assisted Counterparty model: Collateral is pooled and managed collectively
- STX serves as the sole collateral asset for PUT options in the MVP
- Future versions may add support for sBTC as collateral with appropriate risk adjustments

### 3. Protection Claim Flow (Protocol → Buyer)

When protection is activated due to price conditions:

**Asset Flow:**

1. **Claim Initiation:**

   - Protection automatically becomes eligible for claiming when BTC price falls below strike price
   - No explicit claim transaction is required from the buyer in automated implementations

2. **Claim Settlement:**
   - Protected value is calculated: (Strike Price - Current Price) × Protected BTC Amount
   - Equivalent value in STX is transferred from the seller's collateral to the buyer
   - Remaining collateral is returned to the seller

**Implementation Details:**

- Settlement is triggered by oracle price feeds crossing the strike threshold
- No actual BTC is transferred; settlement occurs in STX at current market value
- Settlement transactions execute on Stacks blockchain using smart contracts
- In the Assisted Counterparty model, settlements are processed from the collective pool

### 4. Protocol Revenue Flows (Various Sources → Protocol Treasury)

The protocol generates revenue through several mechanisms:

**Asset Flow:**

1. **Platform Fee Revenue:**

   - 8-15% of all premiums are directed to the protocol treasury
   - Higher fees may apply for specialized protection policies or custom parameters

2. **Transaction Fee Revenue:**

   - Small transaction fees (in STX) are charged for various protocol actions
   - May include policy creation, modification, transfer, or settlement

3. **Optional Subscription Revenue:**
   - Advanced features may require subscription payments (in STX)
   - May include enhanced analytics, priority policy matching, or portfolio management tools

**Implementation Details:**

- All protocol revenue is initially collected in STX
- Protocol treasury is managed through governance mechanisms
- Revenue is used for protocol operations, development, and possibly profit distribution
- A portion of revenue may be used for market making activities in thin market conditions

## Detailed Fee Structure Analysis

The BitHedge protocol employs a multi-tiered fee structure that balances revenue generation with market competitiveness:

### 1. Premium-Based Fees

| Fee Type         | Recipient         | Percentage | Purpose                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| **Base Premium** | Protection Seller | 80-90%     | Compensation for risk   |
| **Protocol Fee** | Protocol Treasury | 8-15%      | Protocol sustainability |
| **Network Fee**  | Blockchain        | 2-5%       | Transaction execution   |

The specific distribution percentages may be adjusted through governance based on market conditions and protocol development stage.

### 2. Transaction-Based Fees

| Transaction Type              | Fee Amount  | Recipient | Purpose                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Protection Creation**       | 0.1-1 STX   | Protocol  | Processing and storage costs  |
| **Protection Activation**     | 0.1-1 STX   | Protocol  | Settlement execution costs    |
| **Collateral Management**     | 0.1-0.5 STX | Protocol  | Collateral verification costs |
| **Secondary Market Transfer** | 0.1-1 STX   | Protocol  | Transfer processing costs     |

These transaction fees are designed to be minimal while covering the operational costs associated with each action.

### 3. Incentive Fee Adjustments

The protocol may implement dynamic fee adjustments to incentivize behavior that benefits ecosystem health:

| Incentive                        | Fee Adjustment       | Purpose                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Early Liquidity Provider**     | 25-50% fee discount  | Bootstrap initial liquidity                |
| **Long-Term Protection**         | 10-25% fee discount  | Encourage longer-term protection provision |
| **Large Volume Providers**       | Tiered fee discounts | Attract institutional liquidity providers  |
| **Balanced Portfolio Providers** | 5-15% fee discount   | Encourage diverse protection offerings     |

These adjustments are crucial during the early phases to address the chicken-and-egg problem of marketplace liquidity.

## Collateralization Mechanics and Risk Management

### 1. Collateral Asset Requirements in MVP

The protocol accepts STX as the collateral asset for PUT options in the MVP:

| Collateral Asset | Collateralization Ratio | Liquidation Threshold | Advantages                                | Disadvantages                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **STX**          | 100%                    | N/A in MVP            | Native to platform, simple implementation | Potential price volatility relative to BTC |

In the MVP implementation, a simplified collateralization model is used with 100% collateral requirement. This ensures the seller can fully cover potential settlements while maintaining implementation simplicity.

### 2. Future Collateral Model (Post-MVP)

In future versions, the protocol plans to implement a more sophisticated collateralization model:

| Collateral Asset | Collateralization Ratio | Liquidation Threshold | Advantages                                       | Disadvantages                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **sBTC**         | 100-110%                | 102%                  | Direct 1:1 BTC backing, lower ratio requirements | Limited availability, may require wrapping |
| **STX**          | 150-200%                | 120%                  | Greater availability, native to platform         | Higher volatility, requires larger buffers |

The higher collateralization ratio for STX will account for its potential price volatility relative to BTC, ensuring the protocol remains solvent even during market stress.

### 3. Collateral Management System

Protection sellers must maintain adequate collateralization throughout the policy period:

1. **Initial Collateralization:**

   - Collateral locked when protection is created
   - Must meet minimum collateralization ratio (100% in MVP)

2. **Settlement Process:**
   - Upon protection activation, collateral equivalent to payout value is transferred to buyer
   - Remaining collateral is released back to seller

In the MVP, the simplified model does not include dynamic collateral adjustments or liquidation mechanisms.

## Income Generation Mechanisms for Participants

### 1. Protection Seller Income (Income Irene)

Protection sellers generate revenue through several mechanisms:

1. **Premium Income:**

   - 80-90% of protection premiums flow directly to sellers
   - Represents primary source of income for protection providers

2. **Capital Efficiency Optimization:**

   - Advanced sellers can manage portfolios of protection policies with correlated risks
   - Experienced sellers may implement delta-neutral strategies to maximize returns

3. **Potential Acquisition Discount:**
   - When protection activates, sellers effectively purchase BTC exposure at below-market rates
   - Some sellers may deliberately offer protection at strikes where they'd be willing to buy

**Annualized Yield Calculation:**

```
Annual Percentage Yield = (Premium Income ÷ Collateral Value) × (365 ÷ Protection Period in Days) × 100%
```

For example, a 30-day protection policy with a 2% premium and 100% collateralization has an APY of approximately 24.33%.

### 2. Protocol Income (Treasury)

The protocol generates revenue for sustainability and development:

1. **Fee Revenue:**

   - 8-15% of all premium payments
   - Transaction fees from various protocol actions
   - Potential subscription revenue from advanced features

2. **Treasury Management:**
   - Protocol-owned liquidity deployment
   - Strategic investments in ecosystem development
   - Reserves for contingency operations

The protocol's economic design ensures that increased usage directly correlates with increased sustainability.

## Asset Flow in Different Implementation Models

The BitHedge ecosystem sustainability analysis proposes three potential implementation models. Each model creates distinct asset flow patterns:

### 1. Pure P2P Marketplace Model

**Asset Flow Characteristics:**

1. **Direct Counterparty Interactions:**

   - Premiums flow directly between buyers and sellers with protocol as intermediary
   - Each protection policy has a specific, identifiable counterparty
   - Collateral is individually managed for each protection seller

2. **Fragmented Liquidity:**

   - Capital is distributed across many individual protection sellers
   - Each strike price and expiration date requires specific matching sellers
   - Natural price discovery through bid-ask matching

3. **Market-Driven Pricing:**
   - Protection premiums determined by supply and demand
   - Price efficiency improves with increased participation
   - May experience premium volatility during market stress

### 2. Assisted Counterparty Model

**Asset Flow Characteristics:**

1. **Pooled Capital Structure:**

   - Liquidity providers deposit capital into a collective smart contract pool
   - Protection buyers interact with the pool rather than individual counterparties
   - Capital efficiency improved through aggregation and risk sharing

2. **Consolidated Liquidity:**

   - Single liquidity pool serves all protection requests within parameters
   - Standardized protection policies priced algorithmically
   - Reduced fragmentation improves capital efficiency

3. **Algorithmic Pricing:**
   - Protection premiums calculated by formula rather than direct market matching
   - Generally more stable pricing but potentially less responsive to market changes
   - Parameters adjusted through governance rather than real-time price discovery

### 3. Hybrid Model (Recommended Approach)

**Asset Flow Characteristics:**

1. **Dual Liquidity Sources:**

   - Protection sourced from both pooled liquidity and direct peer providers
   - Smart routing selects optimal source based on availability and pricing
   - Progressive transition from pool-dominated to peer-dominated over time

2. **Adaptive Capital Allocation:**

   - Protocol-owned liquidity deployed to optimize yield across both models
   - Gradually shifting capital allocation as peer marketplace matures
   - Strategic liquidity provision to address market gaps

3. **Blended Pricing Mechanism:**
   - Algorithmic baseline pricing with market-driven adjustments
   - Price discovery improvement as peer market develops
   - Protection buyers benefit from price competition between models

This hybrid model provides the most robust path to sustainability by combining the reliability of pooled liquidity with the efficiency of peer-to-peer markets.

## Technical Implementation Requirements

Implementing the proposed asset flow model requires specific technical components:

### 1. MVP Smart Contract Architecture
