   - Follow established Clarity best practices

## Conclusion

This specification document outlines the core responsibilities and functionality of each smart contract in the BitHedge platform. During implementation, developers should follow these guidelines while maintaining the flexibility to optimize the specific design patterns and implementation details. Each contract should adhere to the defined responsibilities and integration points, ensuring a cohesive and secure protocol architecture.

The contracts should be implemented in phases, prioritizing the core functionality first (Policy Registry, Liquidity Pool, Oracle, Parameter Contract) followed by the supporting contracts. This approach enables the gradual enhancement of platform capabilities while maintaining operational stability.

Regular code reviews, comprehensive testing, and security audits are essential for all contract implementations to ensure they meet the platform's security and reliability requirements.
