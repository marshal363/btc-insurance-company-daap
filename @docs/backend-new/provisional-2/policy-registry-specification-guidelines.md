# BitHedge Policy Registry: On-Chain Contract Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specification for the on-chain Policy Registry contract within the BitHedge platform. Following the "On-Chain Light" approach, this contract is designed to store only the essential data and logic needed for secure, trustless operation while leaving complex business logic, indexing, and metadata management to the off-chain Convex backend.

## 2. Contract Purpose

The Policy Registry contract serves as the official on-chain record of all BitHedge protection policies. Its core purposes are:

1. Store essential policy terms that define the financial agreement
2. Track policy ownership and status
3. Validate policy operations (activation, expiration)
4. Emit events for off-chain synchronization
5. Provide controlled access to policy data
6. Track position types (LONG vs SHORT) for clear financial roles
7. Manage premium distribution to policy counterparties
8. Track collateral token types and settlement asset information

## 3. Data Structures

### 3.1 Primary Data Structure

```clarity
;; Policy entry - the core data structure
(define-map policies
  { id: uint }                              ;; Key: unique policy ID
  {
    owner: principal,                       ;; Policy owner (buyer)
    counterparty: principal,                ;; Counterparty (typically the pool)
    protected-value: uint,                  ;; Strike price in base units (e.g., satoshis for BTC)
    protection-amount: uint,                ;; Amount being protected in base units
    expiration-height: uint,                ;; Block height when policy expires
    premium: uint,                          ;; Premium amount paid in base units
    policy-type: (string-ascii 4),          ;; "PUT" or "CALL"
    position-type: (string-ascii 9),        ;; "LONG_PUT", "SHORT_PUT", "LONG_CALL", or "SHORT_CALL"
    collateral-token: (string-ascii 4),     ;; Token used as collateral ("STX" or "sBTC")
    protected-asset: (string-ascii 4),      ;; Asset being protected ("BTC")
    settlement-token: (string-ascii 4),     ;; Token used for settlement if exercised ("STX" or "sBTC")
    status: (string-ascii 10),              ;; "Active", "Exercised", "Expired"
    creation-height: uint,                  ;; Block height when policy was created
    premium-distributed: bool,              ;; Whether premium has been distributed to counterparty
    premium-paid: bool                      ;; Whether premium has been paid by owner
  }
)

;; Counter for policy IDs
(define-data-var policy-id-counter uint u0)

;; Backend authorized principal - for automated operations
(define-data-var backend-authorized-principal principal tx-sender)
```

### 3.2 Indexing Data Structures

```clarity
;; Index of policies by owner
(define-map policies-by-owner
  { owner: principal }
  { policy-ids: (list 50 uint) }
)

;; Index of policies by counterparty
(define-map policies-by-counterparty
  { counterparty: principal }
  { policy-ids: (list 50 uint) }
)
```

### 4.3 Batch Operations

```clarity
;; Expire multiple policies in a single transaction
;; Can only be called by the backend authorized principal
(define-public (expire-policies-batch (policy-ids (list 50 uint)))
  (begin
    ;; Verify caller is authorized
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender (var-get backend-authorized-principal))
              ERR-UNAUTHORIZED)

    ;; Use fold to process each policy ID
    (fold expire-policy-fold policy-ids (ok true))
  )
)

;; Helper function for batch expiration
(define-private (expire-policy-fold (policy-id uint) (previous-result (response bool uint)))
  (begin
    ;; Only proceed if previous operations succeeded
    (asserts! (is-ok previous-result) previous-result)

    ;; Try to expire this policy
    (match (try-expire-policy policy-id)
      success success
      error (ok true)) ;; Continue even if a policy fails
  )
)

;; Try to expire a single policy
(define-private (try-expire-policy (policy-id uint))
  (let
    (
      ;; Get the policy entry
      (policy (map-get? policies { id: policy-id }))
    )
    (match policy
      entry (begin
        ;; Only expire if active and past expiration
        (if (and (is-eq (get status entry) STATUS-ACTIVE)
                 (>= block-height (get expiration-height entry)))
            (begin
              ;; Update the policy status
              (map-set policies
                { id: policy-id }
                (merge entry { status: STATUS-EXPIRED })
              )

              ;; Emit event
              (print {
                event: "policy-status-updated",
                policy-id: policy-id,
                new-status: STATUS-EXPIRED,

                settlement-token: (get settlement-token entry)
              })

              (ok true)
            )
            (ok true)) ;; Skip if already non-active or not expired
      )
      (ok true) ;; Policy not found, just continue
    )
  )
)
```

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:** The current implementation of `expire-policies-batch` has been simplified for the initial version of the contract. Instead of using the `fold` operation described above, it currently verifies authorization and logs the batch attempt but doesn't actually expire individual policies. This simplified approach was adopted to ensure contract compatibility and avoid potential syntax errors during the initial deployment.
>
> For the time being, the Convex backend should:
>
> 1. Continue to call `expire-policies-batch` for tracking purposes
> 2. Additionally use individual `update-policy-status` calls for each policy requiring expiration
> 3. A future update will implement the full fold-based batch processing as described in this specification
>
> This temporary limitation doesn't affect the core functionality as policies can still be expired individually, and the full batch implementation will be added in a subsequent update without changing the function signature.

## 5. Testing Guidelines

The Policy Registry contract should be thoroughly tested across the following dimensions:

### 5.1 Unit Tests

1. Policy creation with various parameters
2. Status transitions (Active → Exercised, Active → Expired)
3. Batch expiration of multiple policies
4. Authorization checks for all sensitive functions
5. Edge cases (e.g., policy at expiration boundary)
6. Position type assignment and verification
7. Premium distribution functionality for expired policies
8. Counterparty index updating and querying
9. Collateral and settlement token assignment based on policy type
10. Premium payment verification

### 5.2 Integration Tests

1. Policy creation with premium payment to Liquidity Pool
2. Policy exercise with settlement from Liquidity Pool
3. Multi-contract workflows with Oracle price checks
4. Event emission and consumption by off-chain components
5. Premium distribution flow to counterparties
6. Position type handling across contracts
7. Collateral tracking and settlement token verification

## 6. Gas Optimization Considerations

The "On-Chain Light" approach significantly reduces gas costs through several techniques:

1. **Minimal Data Storage**:

   - Only essential policy terms are stored on-chain
   - Derived data calculated off-chain

2. **Efficient Indexing**:

   - Limited number of indices
   - Constrained list sizes (e.g., max 50 policies per owner/counterparty)

3. **Batch Operations**:

   - Support for bulk expiration reduces per-policy gas costs
   - Backend-initiated maintenance operations

4. **Read vs. Write Optimization**:
   - Expensive calculations available via read-only functions
   - Status updates only when necessary

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 Authorization Model

1. **Owner-Only Operations**:

   - Policy owners can exercise their own policies
   - Owners cannot modify policy terms or affect others' policies

2. **Counterparty Operations**:

   - Counterparties can process premium distribution for their expired policies
   - Cannot modify policy terms or exercise policies

3. **Backend Operations**:

   - Backend can expire policies but only if they're past expiration
   - Backend can process premium distribution for expired policies
   - Backend cannot exercise policies or modify terms

4. **Contract Owner**:
   - Can update the backend authorized principal
   - Cannot directly modify policy data

### 7.2 Potential Vulnerabilities

1. **Front-Running**:

   - Policy activation could be front-run near boundary conditions
   - Mitigated by Oracle integration and price validation

2. **DoS Risks**:

   - List length limits prevent resource exhaustion
   - Batch operations constrained to reasonable sizes

3. **Data Validation**:
   - All inputs validated before processing
   - Explicit checks on critical values (e.g., prices, amounts)
   - Collateral and settlement token validation

## 8. Event Emission Standards

For effective off-chain synchronization, the contract emits standardized events:

```clarity
;; Policy Creation
(print {

## 9. Performance Considerations

To optimize for performance, the contract:

1. Uses simple data structures that minimize lookup costs
2. Provides batch operations for efficiency
3. Keeps index updates minimal (one policy list per owner and counterparty)
4. Avoids complex calculations in write operations
5. Uses appropriate data types to minimize storage needs

## 10. Contract Dependencies

The Policy Registry has these dependencies:

1. **Oracle Contract**: For price data during activation checks
2. **Liquidity Pool Vault**: For premium collection and settlement
3. **Parameter Contract**: For system configuration values

These contracts are referenced but not directly imported, maintaining modularity.

## 11. Comparison With Previous Approach

This "On-Chain Light" approach differs from the previous implementation:

### Previous Approach:

- Stored extensive metadata on-chain
- Managed complex indices for efficient queries
- Performed calculations and validations on-chain
- Attempted to handle all policy lifecycle management in contract

### Current Approach:

- Stores minimal core data on-chain
- Uses Convex for extensive indexing and queries
- Performs complex calculations off-chain
- Splits lifecycle management between on-chain and off-chain
- Explicitly identifies position types (LONG vs SHORT)
- Tracks premium distribution to counterparties
- Adds collateral and settlement token tracking

## 12. Financial Roles and Position Types

The contract explicitly models the financial roles in the BitHedge platform:

1. **Protective Peter (LONG PUT Position)**:

   - BTC holder seeking downside protection
   - Pays premium for protection
   - Can exercise policy if BTC price falls below strike
   - Stored as the `owner` with position type `LONG_PUT`
   - Protected asset is BTC, receives settlement in STX

2. **Income Irene (SHORT PUT Position)**:

   - Liquidity provider seeking premium income
   - Receives premium income for selling protection
   - Takes on risk if BTC price falls below strike
   - Stored as the `counterparty` with position type `SHORT_PUT`
   - Provides STX as collateral for potential settlement

3. **Position Tracking**:
   - Position types automatically assigned during policy creation
   - For PUT options, owner gets `LONG_PUT`, counterparty gets `SHORT_PUT`
   - For CALL options, owner gets `LONG_CALL`, counterparty gets `SHORT_CALL`
   - Position type is immutable throughout policy lifecycle

## 13. Premium Distribution

Premium distribution is a key aspect of the BitHedge financial model:

1. **Initial Premium Payment**:

   - When a policy is created, the owner pays a premium
   - This premium is initially held in the pool
   - Premium payment must be verified before policy creation

2. **Premium Distribution Process**:

   - When a policy expires (not exercised), the premium can be distributed to the counterparty
   - Distribution can be triggered by either the backend or the counterparty directly
   - Distribution is tracked via the `premium-distributed` boolean

3. **Distribution Constraints**:

   - Premium can only be distributed once
   - Premium can only be distributed for expired (not exercised) policies
   - Only the counterparty or backend can trigger distribution

4. **Event Emission**:
   - Premium distribution emits a dedicated event type for off-chain tracking
   - Contains policy ID, counterparty, premium amount, and token information

## 14. Asset and Token Model

The BitHedge platform uses a specific asset and token model:

1. **PUT Options (MVP Focus)**:

   - Protected Asset: BTC (tracked in policy as `protected-asset`)
   - Collateral Token: STX (tracked in policy as `collateral-token`)
   - Settlement Token: STX (tracked in policy as `settlement-token`)
   - When price drops below strike, buyer receives STX as compensation

2. **CALL Options (Future)**:

   - Protected Asset: BTC (tracked in policy as `protected-asset`)
   - Collateral Token: sBTC (tracked in policy as `collateral-token`)
   - Settlement Token: sBTC (tracked in policy as `settlement-token`)
   - When price rises above strike, buyer receives sBTC

3. **Token Assignment**:
   - Tokens are automatically assigned based on policy type during creation
   - This ensures consistent collateral and settlement across the platform
   - Simplifies integration with the Liquidity Pool

## 15. Conclusion

The Policy Registry contract specification embodies the "On-Chain Light" architectural approach by focusing on:

1. Essential data storage for trust and security
2. Clear ownership and authorization boundaries
3. Minimal but sufficient event emission
4. Gas-efficient operations
5. Integration with the broader hybrid architecture
6. Explicit position type identification
7. Premium distribution tracking and processing
8. Collateral and settlement token tracking

By keeping the on-chain footprint small while providing the necessary trust guarantees, this design balances security, scalability, and cost efficiency for the BitHedge platform.
