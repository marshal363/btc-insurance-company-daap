# Refactoring Plan: Blockchain Integration Layer Modularization

**Date:** 2024-09-03
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction and Goal

The primary goal of this refactoring effort is to create a modular, scalable, and maintainable Blockchain Integration Layer that will serve multiple components of the BitHedge platform. Currently, blockchain integration code is focused on the Oracle component with code distributed across `blockchainIntegration.ts`, `blockchainPreparation.ts`, and `prices.ts`. With the upcoming implementation of Policy Registry and Liquidity Pool blockchain integrations (as outlined in the implementation roadmap Phase 3), now is the ideal time to establish a proper architecture for all blockchain interactions.

This initiative aims to:

1. Create a common foundation for all blockchain operations
2. Separate concerns into clearly defined modules
3. Reduce code duplication across blockchain integrations
4. Make the codebase more testable and maintainable
5. Support the efficient implementation of the roadmap's BI-PR-301 through BI-PR-314 and BI-LP-301 through BI-LP-318 tasks
6. Preserve backward compatibility with existing frontend components and services
7. Clearly identify and handle deprecated or legacy code

This plan is based on the analysis of existing blockchain integration code and in accordance with the project documentation, including:

- `@docs/backend-new/provisional-2/implementation-roadmap.md`
- `@docs/backend-new/provisional-2/contracts-interaction-flow.md`

## 4. Overall Strategy

- **Modular Architecture:** The refactoring will follow a clear separation of concerns with well-defined module boundaries.

- **Recommended Folder Structure:** The following directory structure will be implemented:

  ```
  convex/
  ├── blockchain/
  │   ├── common/
  │   │   ├── network.ts         # Network configuration, environment vars
  │   │   ├── transaction.ts     # Transaction building, signing, broadcasting
  │   │   ├── contracts.ts       # Contract addresses and shared utilities
  │   │   ├── eventListener.ts   # Common event listening utilities
  │   │   └── utils.ts           # Common blockchain utilities
  │   ├── oracle/
  │   │   ├── priceReader.ts     # Reading price data from chain
  │   │   ├── priceWriter.ts     # Writing price updates to chain
  │   │   └── types.ts           # Oracle-specific types
  │   ├── policyRegistry/
  │   │   ├── reader.ts          # Policy read operations
  │   │   ├── writer.ts          # Policy write operations
  │   │   ├── events.ts          # Policy event handling
  │   │   └── types.ts           # Policy blockchain types
  │   └── liquidityPool/
  │       ├── reader.ts          # LP read operations
  │       ├── writer.ts          # LP write operations
  │       ├── events.ts          # LP event handling
  │       └── types.ts           # LP blockchain types

  │       ├── mocks.ts           # Shared testing utilities
  │       ├── oracleMocks.ts     # Oracle-specific mocks
  │       ├── policyMocks.ts     # Policy-specific mocks
  │       └── liquidityMocks.ts  # Liquidity pool-specific mocks
  ├── services/
      ├── oracle/                # Price calculation services
      │   └── premiumCalculation.ts # Move from premium.ts
      ├── policyRegistry/        # Already refactored policy services
      └── liquidityPool/         # Existing LP services
  ```

- **Module Responsibility:** Each module will have a clearly defined responsibility, with separation between read operations, write operations, and event handling.

- **Incremental Changes with Backward Compatibility:** The refactoring will be implemented incrementally with adapter layers to maintain backward compatibility:

  - Keep existing files working while implementing new structure
  - Test both implementations side-by-side
  - Switch over only after parity is confirmed
  - Use feature flags to control which implementation is active

- **Dependency Management:**

  - Types and interfaces: Centralized in component-specific `types.ts` files
  - Common utilities: Shared via imports from `convex/blockchain/common/*`
  - Clean dependencies: Minimize circular dependencies through careful module design

- **Testing:** Develop unit tests for each module alongside implementation to ensure reliability.

- **Frontend Integration Preservation:** Maintain compatibility with the existing frontend components, particularly `BitcoinPriceCard.tsx` and related hooks.

## 5. Current Interconnection Analysis

Before proceeding with refactoring, it's crucial to understand the existing interconnections in the codebase to prevent functionality breakage:

### 5.1 Backend Component Dependencies

1. **Oracle Data Flow**:

   - `prices.ts` → `blockchainIntegration.ts` → Oracle Contract
   - `hooks/useBitcoinPrice.ts` and `oracleQueries.ts` → Convex queries → Oracle data

2. **Transaction Handling**:

   - `transactionStatusJobs.ts` monitors transaction status with mocks
   - `poolTransactionWatcher.ts` tracks pool transactions
   - Both depend on blockchain interaction patterns

3. **Premium & Settlement Services**:

   - `premium.ts` (701 lines) provides core premium calculation logic
   - `settlementJobs.ts` processes settlement with mock blockchain interactions
   - These services depend on but are separate from direct blockchain interaction

4. **Simulation & Testing**:
   - `mocks.ts` provides blockchain simulation functions used throughout

### 5.2 Frontend Integration Points

The `BitcoinPriceCard.tsx` component is a critical frontend element that:

- Fetches price data via `api.prices.getLatestPrice`
- Uses `useCalculate24hRange()` from hooks
- Depends on `useIsAuthorizedSubmitter` to determine permissions
- Shows price feed, volatility, and 24h ranges

## 6. Risk Mitigation Strategy

To ensure a smooth refactoring process without breaking existing functionality:

### 6.1 Interface Preservation Pattern

We will create adapter layers between old and new implementations:

```typescript
// Example adapter approach
// in blockchainIntegration.ts (preserved file)

import { readLatestOraclePrice } from "./blockchain/oracle/priceReader";

// Keep original function signature but delegate to new implementation
export async function getOraclePrice() {
  return await readLatestOraclePrice();
}
```

### 6.2 Incremental Refactoring with Dual Implementation

- Keep existing files working while implementing new structure
- Test both implementations side-by-side
- Switch over only after parity is confirmed
- Use feature flags to control which implementation is active

### 6.3 Deprecated Code Identification

- Implement usage tracking/logging to identify truly unused files
- Create a deprecation registry that marks files with:
  - Last usage date
  - Replacement module
  - Planned removal date

### 6.4 Specific File Handling

- **premium.ts**: Move to `services/oracle/premiumCalculation.ts` as it contains business logic rather than blockchain integration
- **options.ts**: Compare with `premium.ts` to identify duplicated functionality; mark for deprecation if necessary
- **mocks.ts**: Restructure into component-specific mock files in the `blockchain/testing` directory

## 7. Refactoring Phases and Detailed Steps

    - Mark functions as deprecated with JSDoc tags
    - Create deprecation registry
    - Document migration paths
  - **Rationale:** Provide clear path for future cleanup while maintaining stability.

- **Step 5.6: Final Clean-Up** ⬜
  - **Action:** Final code cleanup and organization
  - **Implement:**
    - Remove any redundant code
    - Resolve any remaining TODOs
    - Ensure consistent formatting and naming
  - **Rationale:** Ensure codebase is clean and professional.

## 8. Execution and Review Process

- **Task Execution:** Each phase will be executed sequentially, with tasks within phases potentially executed in parallel where dependencies allow.
- **Testing Strategy:** Each module will be tested as it's completed, with integration tests added as modules are connected.
- **Code Review:** Regular code reviews will ensure adherence to the architectural plan and coding standards.
- **API Stability:** Maintain backward compatibility for existing services during the refactoring using adapter layers.
- **Documentation:** Generate up-to-date API documentation as modules are completed.
- **Risk Monitoring:** Continuously track dependencies and potential breaking changes.

## 9. Timeline and Trade-offs

**Proposed Timeline:**

- Phase 0-1: Week 1
- Phase 2: Week 2
- Phase 3-4: Weeks 3-4
- Phase 5: Week 4 (in parallel with Phase 4)

**Key Trade-offs:**

1. **Full Rewrite vs. Incremental Refactoring**

   - Full rewrite: Cleaner architecture but higher risk
   - Incremental: Lower risk but temporary complexity
   - **Decision**: Incremental approach with adapter layers to minimize risk

2. **Monolithic vs. Microservice Architecture**

   - Current approach is module-based but still within single codebase
   - Future could separate concerns more drastically
   - **Decision**: Modular monolith as intermediate step

3. **Testing vs. Development Speed**

   - More testing = lower risk but slower progress
   - **Decision**: Focus testing on critical paths (price data, transactions)

4. **Migration Timeline**
   - Aggressive: Complete in 2-3 weeks with dedicated focus
   - Conservative: 4-6 weeks with parallel feature development
   - **Decision**: 4-week timeline with checkpoints after each phase

## 10. Assessing Success

The successful completion of this refactoring will be assessed based on the following criteria:

- **Modularity:** Blockchain integration code is properly separated into focused modules.
- **Code Reuse:** Common operations are implemented once and reused across components.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage for all modules.
- **Performance:** No regression in performance for existing functionality.
- **Maintainability:** Codebase is easier to understand, modify, and extend.
- **Roadmap Alignment:** Implementation successfully supports all Phase 3 roadmap tasks.
- **Frontend Compatibility:** No breakage of existing frontend components, particularly `BitcoinPriceCard.tsx`.
- **Service Stability:** All dependent services continue to function correctly.

This plan provides a structured approach to creating a robust Blockchain Integration Layer that will serve the BitHedge platform's current and future needs, with careful attention to preserving existing functionality throughout the refactoring process.
