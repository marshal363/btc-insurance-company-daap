# Refactoring Plan: convex/policyRegistry.ts Modularization

**Date:** 2024-08-31
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Introduction and Goal

The primary goal of this refactoring effort is to decompose the `convex/policyRegistry.ts` file (currently at 1569 lines) into a set of smaller, more manageable, and functionally cohesive modules. This initiative aims to significantly improve the maintainability, scalability, readability, and testability of the Policy Registry Convex backend codebase, following the same pattern successfully used for the Liquidity Pool refactoring.

This plan is based on the analysis of `convex/policyRegistry.ts` and in accordance with the existing project documentation.

## 4. Overall Strategy

- **Incremental Changes:** The refactoring will be performed module by module to minimize risk and allow for easier review and validation at each stage.
- **Directory Structure:** A new directory, `convex/policyRegistry/`, will be created to house the new, modularized files.
- **Module Responsibility:** Each new module will have a clearly defined responsibility, grouping related functionalities.
- **Dependency Management:**
  - Types and Enums: Centralized in `convex/policyRegistry/types.ts`.
  - Internal Module Dependencies: Direct relative imports will be used for dependencies between modules within `convex/policyRegistry/`.
- **Testing:** No new tests will be added as part of this refactoring phase, as per current requirements. The focus is on structural improvement.
- **Frontend Impact:** No direct frontend changes are anticipated in this phase; the external API of Convex actions and queries is expected to remain consistent.

## 5. Refactoring Phases and Detailed Steps

### Phase 0: Setup and Foundations

- **Step 0.1: Create Directory Structure** ‚¨ú
  - **Action:** Create the `convex/policyRegistry/` directory.
  - **Rationale:** Establishes the designated location for the refactored modules.
- **Step 0.2: Create `types.ts`** ‚¨ú
  - **Action:** Create `convex/policyRegistry/types.ts`.
  - **Move:** Migrate all enums (`PolicyStatus`, `PolicyType`, `PositionType`, `TokenType`, `PolicyEventType`) and any broadly shared interface/type definitions from the original `convex/policyRegistry.ts` into this new file.
  - **Exports:** Ensure all necessary enums and types are exported from `types.ts`.
  - **Updates:** Modify the original `convex/policyRegistry.ts` to import these enums/types from the new `convex/policyRegistry/types.ts`.
  - **Rationale:** Centralizes common type definitions, enhancing consistency and reusability across the new modules.

### Phase 1: Core Logic Modules (Foundational Services)

- **Step 1.1: Extract `queries.ts`** ‚¨ú

  - **Action:** Create `convex/policyRegistry/queries.ts`.
  - **Responsibilities:** Houses core policy data retrieval functionalities.
  - **Key Functions to Move:**
    - `getPolicy` (query)
    - `getPoliciesForUser` (query)
    - `getPoliciesForCounterparty` (query)
    - `getPolicyEvents` (query)
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports (from `../types.ts`). Export all functions.
  - **Rationale:** Isolates basic data retrieval functions, which are core to all policy operations.

- **Step 1.2: Extract `transactionManager.ts`** ‚¨ú

  - **Action:** Create `convex/policyRegistry/transactionManager.ts`.
  - **Responsibilities:** Manages policy transaction lifecycle.
  - **Key Functions to Move:**
    - `createPendingPolicyTransaction` (internal mutation)
    - `updateTransactionStatus` (internal mutation)
    - `updateTransactionStatusPublic` (mutation)
    - Transaction handling functions (`handleConfirmedPolicyCreation`, `handleConfirmedPolicyActivation`)
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports and exports.
  - **Rationale:** Centralizes transaction management for all policy operations.

- **Step 1.3: Extract `eligibilityChecks.ts`** ‚¨ú

    - `requestPolicyCreation` (action)
    - `determinePolicyPositionType` (internal function)
    - `createPolicyEvent` (internal mutation)
    - `updatePolicyStatus` (internal mutation)
    - Helper functions: `daysToBlockHeight`, `usdToSats`, `btcToSats`
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports and exports.
  - **Rationale:** Centralizes the core policy lifecycle management.

- **Step 2.2: Extract `settlementServices.ts`** ‚¨ú

  - **Action:** Create `convex/policyRegistry/settlementServices.ts`.
  - **Responsibilities:** Manages the settlement process for exercised policies.
  - **Key Functions to Move:**
    - `requestPolicySettlement` (mutation)
    - `updatePolicyToSettled` (internal mutation)
    - `calculateSettlementAmount` (internal function)
    - `preparePolicySettlementTransaction` (internal function)
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports and exports.
  - **Rationale:** Groups settlement logic in one cohesive module.

- **Step 2.3: Extract `eventTracking.ts`** ‚¨ú
  - **Action:** Create `convex/policyRegistry/eventTracking.ts`.
  - **Responsibilities:** Manages the creation and tracking of policy events.
  - **Key Functions to Move:**
    - Any helper functions related to event creation and tracking
    - Event-related internal functions
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports and exports.
  - **Rationale:** Separates event management from core policy operations.

### Phase 3: Financial & Premium Management

- **Step 3.1: Extract `premiumServices.ts`** ‚¨ú

  - **Action:** Create `convex/policyRegistry/premiumServices.ts`.
  - **Responsibilities:** Handles premium calculation and management.
  - **Key Functions to Move:**
    - `calculatePremiumForPolicyCreation` (internal function)
    - Premium-related interfaces and helper functions
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports and exports.
  - **Rationale:** Centralizes premium management functionality.

- **Step 3.2: Extract `premiumDistribution.ts`** ‚¨ú

    - `getCounterpartyIncomeStats` (query)
    - `preparePolicyAcceptanceTransaction` (internal function)
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports and exports.
  - **Rationale:** Groups counterparty-specific functionality.

- **Step 4.2: Extract `reconciliation.ts`** ‚¨ú
  - **Action:** Create `convex/policyRegistry/reconciliation.ts`.
  - **Responsibilities:** Handles reconciliation between on-chain and off-chain state.
  - **Key Functions to Move:**
    - Any existing reconciliation functions or scheduled jobs
    - Placeholder for future reconciliation logic
  - **Updates:** Adjust imports and exports.
  - **Rationale:** Prepares for future state reconciliation functionality.

### Phase 5: Cleanup and Final Review

- **Step 5.1: Update Original `convex/policyRegistry.ts`** ‚¨ú

  - **Action:** After all modules are populated, thoroughly review the original `convex/policyRegistry.ts` file.
  - **Goal:** This file should be significantly reduced in size, ideally becoming a lean re-export layer.
  - **Implementation:** Replace implementation with re-exports from the new modules.

- **Step 5.2: Final Import/Export Validation** ‚¨ú

  - **Action:** Systematically check all newly created modules for correct import paths and ensure that all functions are correctly exported.
  - **Goal:** Ensure complete functionality with the new modular structure.

- **Step 5.3: Verify Convex API Generation** ‚¨ú
  - **Action:** Confirm that Convex's code generation process (`convex/_generated/api.ts`) runs without errors and accurately reflects the new modular structure.
  - **Goal:** Ensure that the refactoring does not break the API generation.

## 6. Execution and Review Process

- **Iterative Execution:** Each step outlined above will be executed sequentially.
- **Communication:** Upon completion of each significant step, report on the changes made.
- **Review:** Review changes after each step to ensure correctness and alignment with the plan.
- **`internal` Functions:** Functions designated as `internalQuery`, `internalMutation`, or `internalAction` will be maintained as internal to their respective modules or the broader `convex/policyRegistry/` scope.

## 7. Assessing Success

The successful completion of this refactoring will be assessed based on the following criteria:

- **Modular Structure:** The `convex/policyRegistry.ts` file is substantially reduced in size, with its functionalities cleanly distributed across the new modules.
- **Clear Responsibilities:** Each new module has a well-defined and distinct responsibility.
- **Maintainability:** The codebase is easier to navigate, understand, and modify.
- **No Functional Regression:** The refactoring should not introduce any changes to the existing external behavior.
- **Convex Generation:** The Convex framework successfully generates the `convex/_generated/api.ts` file without errors.
- **Code Integrity:** All original logic is preserved and correctly relocated.

This plan provides a structured and incremental approach to refactoring `convex/policyRegistry.ts`, aiming for a significantly more robust and maintainable system.
