# BitHedge System Analysis and Critical Components: Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the BitHedge platform architecture, focusing on system components, critical dependencies, integration points, and implementation considerations. BitHedge is a decentralized protocol built on the Stacks blockchain that enables Bitcoin holders to protect their assets against market volatility through options-based insurance policies, while allowing capital providers to earn yield by backing these protection policies.

The analysis examines both currently implemented components and critical components that require further development, providing a holistic view of the complete system architecture necessary for a robust, secure, and scalable platform.

   - Process vesting schedules
   - Handle reward caps and limits

4. **Claim Processing**
   - Validate claim eligibility
   - Process reward claims
   - Track claim history
   - Handle vesting unlocks

#### 3.9.5 Integration Points
- **Policy Registry**: For policy-related activities
- **Liquidity Pool**: For liquidity provision activities
- **Treasury Contract**: For reward funding
- **Governance Contract**: For program approval
- **Analytics Contract**: For program metrics

#### 3.9.6 Implementation Considerations
- The Incentives Contract should be implemented as a separate contract
- The contract should support multiple incentive programs with different parameters
- Reward formulas should be adjustable through governance

### 3.10 Analytics and Reporting System

#### 3.10.1 Purpose
The Analytics Contract collects and stores protocol metrics for reporting and analysis, providing insights into protocol performance, risk factors, and user behavior to inform decision-making.

#### 3.10.2 Key Requirements
1. **Metric Collection**: Gathering data from protocol operations
2. **Time Series Storage**: Maintaining historical data for trending
3. **Aggregation Framework**: Combining data for insights
4. **Query Interface**: Accessing analytics data
5. **Health Monitoring**: Tracking system health indicators

#### 3.10.3 Core State Variables
```clarity
;; Analytics Contract
(define-map protocol-metrics
  { metric-id: (string-ascii 50), period-start: uint }
  {
    value: uint,
    period-duration: uint,  ;; in blocks
    metric-type: (string-ascii 20),  ;; 'cumulative', 'average', 'high', 'low'
    data-points: uint,
    last-updated: uint
  }
)

(define-map system-health-indicators
  { indicator-id: (string-ascii 50) }
  {
    current-value: uint,
    warning-threshold: uint,
    critical-threshold: uint,
    status: (string-ascii 20),  ;; 'healthy', 'warning', 'critical'
    last-updated: uint
  }
)

(define-map metric-definitions
  { metric-id: (string-ascii 50) }
  {
    description: (string-ascii 200),
    unit: (string-ascii 20),
    calculation-method: (string-ascii 50),
    data-source: (string-ascii 50)
  }
)
```

#### 3.10.4 Critical Functions
1. **Metric Recording**
   - Collect metrics from protocol events
   - Store metrics by timeframe
   - Update aggregate statistics
   - Enforce data validation

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - Track system health indicators
   - Calculate health scores
   - Generate health alerts
   - Record status changes

3. **Data Aggregation**
   - Aggregate metrics by timeframe
   - Calculate derived metrics
   - Generate summary statistics
   - Prepare reporting data

4. **Query Processing**
   - Provide read access to metrics
   - Support filtering and aggregation
   - Enable time-series analysis
   - Handle complex queries

#### 3.10.5 Integration Points
- **All Contracts**: For metric collection
- **Governance Contract**: For reporting
- **Parameter Contract**: For threshold configuration
- **Emergency Response**: For health alerts

#### 3.10.6 Implementation Considerations
- The Analytics Contract should be implemented as a lightweight, read-only contract
- The contract should balance data completeness with storage efficiency
- The system should include data retention policies for old metrics

### 3.11 Dispute Resolution Mechanism

#### 3.11.1 Purpose
The Dispute Resolution Contract provides mechanisms for resolving contested actions and claims, offering a fair, transparent process for handling disagreements about oracle data, liquidations, or other protocol operations.

#### 3.11.2 Key Requirements
1. **Dispute Filing**: Process for submitting disputes
2. **Evidence Collection**: Mechanism for submitting evidence
3.
