# BitHedge European-Style Options Architecture: Development Plan

## Project Overview

This development plan outlines the tasks required to implement BitHedge's European-style options architecture on the Stacks blockchain. The project involves building two primary smart contracts (Policy Registry and Liquidity Pool Vault) that will enable the creation, management, and settlement of European-style Bitcoin options (settlement only at expiration).

### Project Objectives

1. Implement a gas-efficient, robust European-style options platform
2. Support the complete policy lifecycle for both buyers and sellers
3. Create mechanisms for efficient capital utilization with expiration-focused design
4. Implement comprehensive verification systems to ensure correctness
5. Optimize for batch processing to reduce gas costs
6. Align implementation with Bitcoin-native mental models

### Key Components

1. **Policy Registry Contract**: Manages policy creation, expiration, and settlement
2. **Liquidity Pool Vault Contract**: Handles capital management and premium distribution
3. **Risk Tier System**: Maps user protection preferences to provider risk tolerance
4. **Settlement and Verification System**: Ensures correct allocation and settlement

### Development Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with core functionality and progressively adding more advanced features. Each phase will include thorough testing and documentation.

## Critical Implementation Details

### Risk Tier System Implementation

The risk tier system is a critical component that maps between buyer protection preferences and provider risk tolerance:

#### Buyer Tiers (Protective Peter):
- **Conservative**: 100% of current value - Maximum protection
- **Standard**: 90% of current value - Standard protection 
- **Flexible**: 80% of current value - Balanced protection
- **Crash Insurance**: 70% of current value - Minimal protection

#### Provider Tiers (Income Irene):
- **Conservative**: Low risk, lower yield, higher collateral ratio (110%)
- **Balanced**: Medium risk, medium yield, standard collateral ratio (100%)
- **Aggressive**: Higher risk, higher yield, lower collateral ratio (90%)

#### Tier Matching Rules:
- ConservativeBuyer → ConservativeProvider
- StandardBuyer → BalancedProvider, ConservativeProvider
- FlexibleBuyer → AggressiveProvider, BalancedProvider
- CrashInsuranceBuyer → Any provider tier

Implementation must ensure these relationships are enforced during policy creation and provider allocation.

### European-Style Settlement Process

The European-style options architecture settles policies only at expiration, not before. This requires:

1. **Expiration Batch Processing**:
   - Policies are processed in batches at their expiration height
   - Oracle price at expiration determines if policies are in-the-money
   - In-the-money policies trigger settlement to policy owners
   - Out-of-the-money policies trigger premium distribution to providers

2. **Settlement Impact Tracking**:
   - Each provider's contribution to settlement is calculated proportionally
   - Settlement impacts must be tracked for verification and accounting
   - Remaining collateral must be released back to providers

3. **Premium Distribution Process**:
   - For expired out-of-the-money policies, premiums are distributed to providers
   - Distribution is proportional to each provider's allocation percentage
   - Premium distribution must be verified for correctness

## Resource Allocation and Timeline

### Team Structure

- **Smart Contract Developers**: 2-3 developers focused on Clarity implementation
- **QA Engineers**: 1-2 engineers focused on testing and verification
- **Project Manager**: 1 person coordinating development and tracking progress
- **Technical Lead**: 1 person providing architectural guidance and code review

2. Comprehensive test suite passing with 100% coverage
3. All verification mechanisms validated on real-world scenarios
4. Gas usage optimized to target levels for all operations
5. Complete user documentation available
6. Monitoring and maintenance systems operational

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing BitHedge's European-style options architecture. By following this plan, the team will be able to build a robust, gas-efficient platform that aligns with Bitcoin-native mental models while ensuring correctness through comprehensive verification mechanisms.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, with clear milestones to track progress. The focus on core functionality first, followed by settlement and verification, and then advanced features, ensures that the most critical components are built and tested thoroughly before adding complexity.
