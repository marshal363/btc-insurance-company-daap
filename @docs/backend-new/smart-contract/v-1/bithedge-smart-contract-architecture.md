# BitHedge Smart Contract Architecture: Comprehensive On-Chain Implementation

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive smart contract architecture for BitHedge's Bitcoin insurance platform, shifting from the previously proposed "On-Chain Light" approach to a more robust on-chain implementation. The architecture aims to minimize off-chain dependencies while supporting the complete policy lifecycle for both buyer (Protective Peter) and seller (Income Irene) personas.

The architecture centers around two primary contracts with enhanced capabilities:
1. **Policy Registry Contract**: Manages the entire policy lifecycle
2. **Liquidity Pool Vault Contract**: Handles capital management and settlement

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Maximized On-Chain Logic**: Move as much business logic as possible to smart contracts
2. **End-to-End Policy Lifecycle**: Support all phases from creation through expiration for both personas
3. **Bitcoin-Native Mental Models**: Align contract functions with user mental models 
4. **Self-Sustaining Ecosystem**: Create mechanisms for sustainable liquidity and incentives
5. **Gas Optimization**: Implement batching and efficient data structures despite increased on-chain logic

```
// Process settlement for a policy at expiration (Called by Policy Registry)
processSettlementAtExpiration(
  policyId: uint,
  recipient: Principal,
  settlementAmount: uint,
  tokenId: TokenId
) -> bool

// Process batch settlements at expiration (System)
processBatchSettlements(
  policyIds: uint[],
  settlementAmounts: uint[],
  recipients: Principal[],

  failedCount: uint
}

// Update provider allocations after settlement (System)

```

## 3. Integration Points Between Contracts

### Policy Registry → Liquidity Pool Vault

```
// During policy creation
1. checkLiquidity() - Verify sufficient liquidity exists for new policy
2. lockCollateral() - Lock collateral for the new policy
3. recordPremiumPayment() - Record premium paid by buyer

// During policy activation
1. processSettlement() - Transfer settlement amount to buyer
2. releaseCollateral() - Release unused collateral

// During policy expiration
1. releaseCollateral() - Release all collateral when policy expires
2. distributePremiumToProviders() - Distribute premium to providers
```

### Liquidity Pool Vault → Policy Registry

```
// Internal read operations
1. getPolicyDetails() - Get details about a policy
2. getCollateralRequirements() - Get collateral requirements for a policy
3. isPolicyActive() - Check if a policy is still active
```

## 4. Risk Tier Implementation

The architecture implements the Bitcoin-native mental models through risk tiers:

```
// For Buyers (Protective Peter)
Conservative Tier: 100% of current value
Standard Tier: 90% of current value
Flexible Tier: 80% of current value
Crash Insurance Tier: 70% of current value

// For Sellers (Income Irene)
Conservative Tier: Lower risk, lower reward
Balanced Tier: Medium risk, medium reward
Aggressive Tier: Higher risk, higher reward
```

Each tier maps to specific contract parameters:

```
// Parameter mapping pseudocode
mapRiskTierToParameters(tier: string, currentPrice: uint) -> {
  strikePrice: uint,
  collateralRatio: uint,
  premiumMultiplier: uint
}
```

## 5. Automated On-Chain Processes

The architecture implements several automated processes that run on-chain:

### Batch Policy Expiration System

```
// Expire all policies that have reached expiration height
processPendingExpirations(currentBlockHeight: uint) -> {
  expiredCount: uint,
  failedCount: uint
}

// Implementation uses a mapping of block heights to policy IDs
// Policies are added to this mapping at creation time
```

### Premium Distribution System

```
// Distribute premiums for all expired policies
processPendingPremiumDistributions() -> {
  distributedCount: uint,
  failedCount: uint
}

// Implementation uses a pendingPremiumDistributions mapping
// Policies are added to this mapping when they expire
```

### Collateral Management System

```
// Optimize collateral allocation across providers
optimizeCollateralAllocation() -> {
  optimizedCount: uint,
  releasedCollateral: uint
}

// Implementation consolidates fragmentary allocations
// Runs periodically to improve capital efficiency
```

## 6. Oracle Integration

The architecture tightly integrates with an Oracle contract:

```
// Oracle functions used by the system
getCurrentBitcoinPrice() -> uint
getBitcoinPriceAtHeight(blockHeight: uint) -> uint
checkPriceValidity(price: uint) -> bool

// Policy Registry integrates Oracle for:
1. Price verification during policy activation
2. Market-aware premium calculations 
3. Protection threshold determinations
```

## 7. Common Operational Flows (European-Style)

### Complete Buyer Flow (Protective Peter)

1. **Policy Creation**:
   - Buyer selects protection parameters (protected value, amount, expiration date, risk tier)
   - System calculates premium based on parameters
   - **Policy Registry calls Liquidity Pool to check available liquidity BEFORE proceeding** (Critical Step)
   - Buyer is prompted to pay premium only if sufficient collateral is available
   - `createProtectionPolicy()` is called with required parameters
   - Policy Registry verifies premium payment
   - Policy Registry calls Liquidity Pool to lock collateral
   - Buyer receives policy ID and confirmation

2. **Policy Monitoring**:
   - Buyer monitors theoretical policy value in dashboard as Bitcoin price fluctuates
   - System shows theoretical settlement value if the policy were to expire immediately
   - UI clearly indicates that actual settlement occurs only at expiration
   - No action is available or required from buyer during the protection period

3. **Policy Expiration and Settlement**:
   - Protection period reaches expiration height
   - System automatically calls `processExpirationAndSettlement()` with Oracle price
   - If policy is in-the-money (price below protected value for PUT), settlement is processed
   - Policy Registry calculates settlement amount based on expiration price
   - Policy Registry instructs Liquidity Pool to transfer settlement
   - Buyer receives settlement amount automatically without any action
   - Policy status changes to "Settled" or "Expired" based on outcome
   - Buyer receives expiration notification with settlement details and renewal options

### Complete Seller Flow (Income Irene)

1. **Capital Commitment**:
   - Seller selects capital amount, token, and risk tier
   - Seller calls `depositCapital()` with parameters
   - Liquidity Pool records deposit and updates provider balance
   - Seller's capital becomes available for allocation

2. **Allocation to Policies**:
   - System automatically allocates seller's capital to new policies
   - Allocation based on risk tier preference and capital available
   - `allocateProviderCapital()` creates provider allocations
   - Seller can view current allocations and expiration schedule in dashboard
   - UI clearly shows expected settlement dates and potential liability at each date

3. **Settlement and Premium Processing**:
   - At expiration, system automatically processes all policies in batch
   - For in-the-money policies, settlements are processed from allocated capital
   - For out-of-the-money policies, premiums are distributed to providers
   - `distributePremiumToProviders()` calculates each provider's share
   - Seller can claim earned premiums via `claimPendingPremiums()`
   - Settlement and premium distribution happen without requiring seller action

4. **Capital Withdrawal**:
   - Seller decides to withdraw available capital
   - Seller calls `withdrawCapital()` with amount and token
   - System verifies available balance (excluding locked capital for unexpired policies)
   - Seller receives withdrawn capital

## 8. Gas Optimization Strategies

Despite moving more logic on-chain, the architecture implements several gas optimization strategies:

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Policies are expired in batches by block height
   - Premium distributions processed in batches
   - Provider allocations managed in groups

2. **Efficient Data Structures**:
   - Limited index mappings with fixed-size arrays
   - Strategic use of minimal storage for common operations
   - Optimized lookups with indexed mappings

3. **Event-Based Processing**:
   - Heavy use of events to signal state changes
   - Off-chain systems can monitor events for user notification
   - Reduces need for polling-based approaches

4. **Deferred Processing**:
   - Computation-heavy operations batched and processed during low-gas periods
   - Premium distributions can be delayed until efficient batch size reached
   - Collateral optimization runs as a background process

## 9. Hybrid Considerations

While this architecture moves much more logic on-chain than the "On-Chain Light" approach, some functions remain better suited for off-chain implementation:

1. **Complex UI Calculations**:
   - Advanced policy simulations and scenario analysis
   - Detailed yield projections and historical analytics
   - Visual price chart generation and technical analysis

2. **User Profile Management**:
   - Personalized recommendations and risk profiling
   - Notification preferences and communication management
   - User interaction history and behavioral analytics

3. **Advanced Market Analysis**:
   - Volatility prediction and time-series analysis
   - Market sentiment monitoring and integration
   - Cross-market correlation monitoring

## 10. Implementation Staging Plan

The architecture can be implemented in distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Core On-Chain Functionality

## 11. Critical Missing Steps Analysis

### 11.1 Policy Creation Process - Critical Missing Steps

The initial architecture overlooked several critical steps in the policy creation process:

1. **Pre-Policy Liquidity Verification (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
   - The system MUST check available liquidity BEFORE accepting premium payment
   - Implementation: `checkLiquidity()` must be called before the buyer is even prompted to pay premium
   - Prevents scenarios where premium is paid but policy cannot be created due to insufficient funds
   - Creates dependable user experience by filtering out impossible policy creation attempts upfront

2. **Premium Payment Atomic Transaction**
   - Premium payment and policy creation should be atomic operations
   - If premium payment succeeds but policy creation fails, funds must be refunded
   - Implementation: Use a compound transaction pattern or escrow mechanism

3. **Oracle Price Freshness Verification**
   - Ensure Oracle price is fresh before policy creation
   - Prevent policies created with stale prices that could immediately be exercisable at expiration
   - Implementation: Check timestamp of Oracle price data, reject if older than threshold

4. **Risk Parameter Validation**
   - Validate all risk parameters are within acceptable bounds
   - Prevent creation of policies with extreme or manipulated parameters

## 12. European-Style Options Benefits Analysis

The adoption of European-style options (settlement only at expiration) provides several significant advantages for the BitHedge platform. This section analyzes these benefits in detail and explains how they enhance the system architecture.

### 12.1 Technical Benefits

1. **Reduced Contract Complexity**
   - **State Reduction**: Eliminating the early activation feature significantly reduces the number of contract states and possible transitions. This simplification results in code that is easier to audit, test, and maintain.
   - **Elimination of Race Conditions**: The architecture no longer needs to handle complex race conditions between activation and expiration, simplifying edge case handling.
   - **Predictable State Transitions**: With only one settlement point (expiration), state transitions become highly predictable and easier to model.

2. **Gas Optimization**
   - **Batched Processing**: Settlement can be processed in batches at predefined expiration heights, significantly reducing gas costs compared to on-demand activations.
   - **Scheduled Execution**: Backend systems can prepare for high-volume settlement periods at known times, optimizing transaction timing and gas pricing.
   - **Reduced Transaction Volume**: Fewer on-chain transactions are needed across the policy lifecycle, reducing overall blockchain congestion.

3. **Enhanced Oracle Integration**
   - **Reduced Oracle Dependence**: The system only needs high-reliability Oracle data at specific expiration times rather than continuously.
   - **Price Manipulation Resistance**: Time-Weighted Average Prices (TWAP) can be implemented at expiration points for better manipulation resistance.
   - **Multi-Oracle Consensus**: For critical expiration events, multiple oracle sources can be aggregated to ensure price accuracy.

4. **Improved Testing and Verification**
   - **Deterministic Behavior**: More deterministic system behavior makes formal verification and comprehensive testing more effective.
   - **Reduced State Space**: The reduced state space enables more thorough automated testing of possible scenarios.
   - **Simplified Security Model**: Security analysis becomes more tractable with fewer interaction points and state transitions.

### 12.2 Economic Benefits

1. **Capital Efficiency**
   - **Predictable Collateral Needs**: Capital providers know exactly when their collateral might be needed (at expiration), allowing for tighter capital planning.
   - **Optimized Collateral Allocation**: Collateral can be allocated more efficiently based on expiration schedules rather than unpredictable early activations.
   - **Higher Utilization Ratios**: The predictability allows for higher capital utilization ratios while maintaining system safety.

2. **Reduced Protocol Costs**
   - **Lower Gas Costs**: Fewer on-chain transactions and batch processing lead to reduced gas costs across the system.
   - **Streamlined Operations**: Simplified contract logic requires less complex off-chain monitoring and management.
   - **Reduced Development Overhead**: Less complex system architecture means faster development cycles and lower maintenance costs.

3. **Market Efficiency**
   - **Standardized Expiration Dates**: The architecture encourages standardization around specific expiration dates, concentrating liquidity.
   - **Improved Risk Modeling**: Providers can model risk more accurately with fixed settlement dates rather than uncertain early exercise.
   - **Clearer Premium Pricing**: Option pricing becomes more straightforward using standard Black-Scholes models for European options.

### 12.3 User Experience Considerations

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**
   - **Clear Value Proposition**: Users understand exactly what they're buying - protection that settles at a specific future date.
   - **Reduced Decision Fatigue**: Eliminates monitoring and decision-making about when to activate protection.
   - **Transparent Outcomes**: Settlement outcomes depend solely on the expiration price, creating transparency.

2. **Educational Aspects**
   - **Easier to Explain**: The European model is easier to explain to new users as it removes the complexity of optimal exercise strategy.
   - **Familiar Financial Instrument**: Aligns with standardized financial products familiar to more sophisticated users.
   - **Theoretical Value Calculation**: Enables clearer representation of theoretical policy value during the protection period.

3. **Possible Limitations**
   - **Perceived Loss of Control**: Users may perceive loss of control by not being able to choose when to activate protection.
   - **Outcome Dependency on Specific Moment**: Settlement value depends entirely on price at a single point in time.
   - **Mitigation Strategy**: Provide clear UI showing theoretical settlement value if expired today, and offer various expiration options.

### 12.4 Protocol Resilience

1. **Systemic Risk Reduction**
   - **Predictable Settlement Events**: Known settlement windows allow for better preparation of system resources and liquidity.
   - **Reduced Flash Crash Vulnerability**: System is less vulnerable to momentary price disruptions as settlement only occurs at specified times.
   - **Better Capacity Planning**: Protocol can plan for and manage peak loads at known expiration times.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring Capabilities**
   - **Focused Monitoring Windows**: System monitoring can focus on critical expiration periods.
   - **Predictive Analytics**: Expiration-based analytics can predict system behavior and liquidity needs.
   - **Early Warning Systems**: Potential issues can be identified well before expiration dates.

### 12.5 Business Strategy Alignment

1. **Market Differentiation**
   - **Clear Differentiator**: European-style settlement provides a clear differentiator in the crypto options space.
   - **Focus on Simplicity**: Aligns with BitHedge's goal of making options accessible to average Bitcoin holders.
   - **Emphasizes Planning**: Encourages users to think strategically about protection periods and expiration dates.

2. **Revenue Model Enhancement**
   - **More Efficient Resource Utilization**: Lower operational costs translate to better margins or more competitive pricing.
   - **Predictable Fee Generation**: More predictable settlement patterns enable better forecasting of fee generation.
   - **Scaling Advantages**: Simplified architecture can scale more efficiently with user growth.

3. **Ecosystem Development**
   - **Standard Expiration Dates**: Creates natural focal points for ecosystem development around standard expiration dates.
   - **Market Making Opportunities**: Creates clear market making opportunities around expiration dates.
   - **Third-Party Integration**: Simplified interface makes third-party integration more straightforward.

The adoption of European-style options represents a significant architectural advantage for BitHedge, aligning technical implementation with economic efficiency and user experience. While requiring some user education about the settlement model, the benefits in terms of system simplicity, cost efficiency, and protocol resilience make this approach superior for the platform's long-term success.
