# BitHedge Oracle Blockchain Integration Implementation

## Implementation of BI-101: Basic `readLatestOraclePrice` function

Based on the Oracle Integration Development Plan, we have implemented the BI-101 task: "Implement Blockchain Integration (Convex): Basic `readLatestOraclePrice` function" with a comprehensive approach that addresses both front-end and back-end communication with the blockchain.

### Front-End Implementation

1. **Contract Configuration**

   - Extended `contracts.ts` to include Oracle and other contracts (liquidity pool, policy registry)
   - Created a generic `StacksContract` interface for consistent contract definitions
   - Added helper functions for getting contract identifiers

2. **Oracle Query Hooks**

   - Created `oracleQueries.ts` with the `useLatestOraclePrice` hook for reading price data
   - Added `useIsAuthorizedSubmitter` hook to check if a wallet is authorized to update the oracle
   - Implemented proper error handling and data formatting

3. **Transaction Utilities**

   - Created `oracle-utils.ts` with functions for generating transaction options:
     - `getSetAggregatedPriceTx` for authorized users to update the price
     - `getSetAuthorizedSubmitterTx` for contract owner to set authorized submitters

4. **UI Components**
   - Updated `BitcoinPriceCard.tsx` to use real blockchain data instead of mock data
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Created `OracleAdminControls.tsx` for authorized submitters to update prices

### Convex Backend Implementation

Created a conceptual implementation of the Convex backend's blockchain integration layer:

1. **Blockchain API Configuration**

   - Functions to configure and initialize the Stacks blockchain API client
   - Network-aware setup (mainnet, testnet, devnet)

2. **Contract Information Management**

   - Functions to get contract details based on the network

3. **Core Read Function**
   - Implemented `readLatestOraclePrice` Convex query function
   - Proper error handling and result formatting

## Architecture for Multi-Contract Integration

Our approach to handling multiple contracts (oracle, liquidity pool, policy registry, etc.) follows these principles:

1. **Modular Contract Configuration**

   - Each contract has its own definition in `contracts.ts`
   - Generic functions for working with any contract (like `getContractIdentifier`)
   - Contract-specific helper functions where needed

2. **Separated Query Hooks**

   - Contract-specific query hook files (e.g., `oracleQueries.ts`)
   - Each hook focuses on a specific contract interaction
   - Consistent patterns for data fetching, error handling, and formatting

3. **Reusable Transaction Utilities**

   - Contract-specific utility files (e.g., `oracle-utils.ts`)
   - Functions to generate transaction options for each contract operation
   - Consistent patterns for handling parameters, post conditions, etc.

4. **UI Component Integration**
   - UI components use the query hooks to display blockchain data
   - Admin components use transaction utilities to submit transactions
   - Network-aware wallet handling (devnet, testnet, mainnet)

## Implementation Challenges and Considerations

1. **Convex Environment Setup**

   - The Convex implementation is conceptual and requires a properly set up Convex project
   - Dependencies like `@stacks/blockchain-api-client` need to be installed
   - Generated server code needs to be available

2. **Cross-Network Compatibility**

   - All implementations handle multiple networks (devnet, testnet, mainnet)
   - Contract addresses are network-specific
   - API endpoints are properly configured based on the network

3. **Error Handling and User Experience**
   - Comprehensive error handling in both front-end and back-end
   - User-friendly error messages and loading states
   - Data formatting for better readability

## Next Steps

According to the Oracle Integration Development Plan, the following tasks should be addressed next:

1. **OC-107**: Deploy refactored `oracle.clar` to Devnet
2. **CVX-201**: Implement/Refine Convex: Robust multi-source price fetching logic
3. **CVX-202**: Implement/Refine Convex: Aggregation logic (weighted median, outlier filtering)
4. **BI-301**: Implement secure backend wallet/key loading from env variables

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Oracle integration, establishing patterns that can be extended to other contracts while maintaining consistency and scalability.
