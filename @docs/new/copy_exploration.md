# BitHedge: Bitcoin-Native Copy Exploration

## Introduction

This document provides copy inspiration for BitHedge's Bitcoin protection variables, transforming technical options concepts into intuitive Bitcoin-native terminology. Our goal is to make these concepts immediately resonate with everyday Bitcoiners by using language that aligns with Bitcoin culture and values while maintaining sufficient connection to familiar insurance/protection concepts.

## Key Variable Alternatives

### 1. Strike Price → Protected Value

**Current Challenge:**
The concept of "strike price" in options trading is abstract and disconnected from users' mental models of protection. We need terminology that conveys value preservation without being overly technical.

**5 Bitcoin-Native Alternatives:**

1. **HODL Floor** - The minimum value level below which your Bitcoin won't fall.

   - _Strengths_: Very Bitcoin-native, memorable, communicates a "floor" concept clearly
   - _Weaknesses_: May be too informal for some users, requires Bitcoin cultural knowledge

2. **Value Shield** - The price level at which your Bitcoin's value becomes protected.

   - _Strengths_: Intuitive protection metaphor, works for both novice and experienced users
   - _Weaknesses_: Less Bitcoin-specific, could apply to any asset

3. **Sats Safeguard** - The value level that keeps your satoshis protected.

   - _Strengths_: Emphasizes the Bitcoin-specific unit (sats), feels protective
   - _Weaknesses_: May confuse users who think primarily in BTC rather than sats

4. **Bitcoin Baseline** - The established value level for your Bitcoin protection.

   - _Strengths_: Clear, professional, indicates a reference point
   - _Weaknesses_: Doesn't strongly communicate the protective aspect

5. **Protection Threshold** - The price point that activates your Bitcoin protection.
   - _Strengths_: Clearly describes function, familiar insurance-adjacent language
   - _Weaknesses_: Less Bitcoin-native, more generic

**UI Implementation Examples:**

- "Set your HODL Floor to 90% of current Bitcoin price"
- "Your Value Shield is active at $43,650"
- "Sats Safeguard: 90,000,000 sats ($43,650)"
- "Bitcoin Baseline: $43,650 (90% of current value)"
- "Protection Threshold: $43,650 activates your coverage"

### 2. Expiration Date → Protection Period

**Current Challenge:**
"Expiration Date" feels technical and negative, while protection timeframes in Bitcoin should align with Bitcoin's unique market cycles.

**5 Bitcoin-Native Alternatives:**

1. **HODL Horizon** - The timeframe during which your Bitcoin value protection remains active.

   - _Strengths_: Evokes long-term Bitcoin perspective, alliteration makes it memorable
   - _Weaknesses_: May not clearly communicate a specific end date

2. **Cycle Shield** - Protection that aligns with Bitcoin's natural market cycles.

   - _Strengths_: References Bitcoin's halving cycles, communicates protection
   - _Weaknesses_: Might be confusing for Bitcoin newcomers

3. **Protection Window** - The specific timeframe when your Bitcoin is protected.

   - _Strengths_: Clear, familiar insurance concept, easy to understand
   - _Weaknesses_: Less Bitcoin-specific

4. **Diamond Hands Period** - The time you can hold with confidence knowing your value is protected.

   - _Strengths_: Uses popular Bitcoin/crypto meme terminology, memorable
   - _Weaknesses_: Potentially too informal, may become dated as memes evolve

5. **Coverage Timeline** - The duration of your Bitcoin value protection.
   - _Strengths_: Professional, straightforward, aligns with insurance terminology
   - _Weaknesses_: Doesn't leverage Bitcoin culture

**UI Implementation Examples:**

- "Select your HODL Horizon: 30 days to full halving cycle"
- "Your Cycle Shield is active until the next halving"
- "Protection Window: April 15 - May 15, 2023"
- "Diamond Hands Period: 90 days of worry-free holding"
- "Coverage Timeline: 30 days from activation"

### 3. Contract Size → Protected Portion

**Current Challenge:**
"Contract Size" is financial jargon that doesn't resonate with how Bitcoiners think about their holdings.

**5 Bitcoin-Native Alternatives:**

1. **Stack Portion** - The specific portion of your Bitcoin stack you want to protect.

   - _Strengths_: Uses "stack" terminology familiar to Bitcoiners, clear
   - _Weaknesses_: May not be clear to complete newcomers

2. **Secured Sats** - The amount of your Bitcoin holdings protected by this policy.

   - _Strengths_: Alliteration makes it memorable, focuses on the Bitcoin unit
   - _Weaknesses_: Some users may think more in terms of BTC than sats

3. **Protected Holdings** - The amount of Bitcoin covered by your protection plan.

   - _Strengths_: Clear, straightforward, works for all experience levels
   - _Weaknesses_: Less Bitcoin-native terminology

4. **HODL Amount** - The quantity of Bitcoin you're protecting while you continue to hold.

   - _Strengths_: Incorporates iconic Bitcoin terminology, clear purpose
   - _Weaknesses_: Could be confused with total holdings rather than protected amount

5. **Coverage Quantity** - The specific amount of Bitcoin protected by your policy.
   - _Strengths_: Insurance-familiar language, precise
   - _Weaknesses_: More generic, less Bitcoin-specific

**UI Implementation Examples:**

- "Select Stack Portion: 0.25 BTC (25,000,000 sats)"
- "Secured Sats: 25,000,000 ($12,125)"
- "Protected Holdings: 0.25 BTC"
- "HODL Amount: 0.25 BTC of your total 1 BTC"
- "Coverage Quantity: 0.25 BTC"

### 4. Premium → Protection Cost

**Current Challenge:**
"Premium" is insurance jargon that feels disconnected from the Bitcoin ecosystem, while "cost" can feel negative.

**5 Bitcoin-Native Alternatives:**

1. **HODL Fee** - The one-time cost to secure your Bitcoin's value while continuing to hold.

   - _Strengths_: Bitcoin-native terminology, implies one-time payment
   - _Weaknesses_: "Fee" can have negative connotations

2. **Protection Sats** - The satoshis you spend to protect your Bitcoin value.

   - _Strengths_: Denominated in Bitcoin's own unit, frames cost as an investment
   - _Weaknesses_: Might be confused with the amount being protected

3. **Security Investment** - What you pay to secure your Bitcoin's value.

   - _Strengths_: Frames cost as positive investment rather than expense
   - _Weaknesses_: Less Bitcoin-specific

4. **Stack Insurance** - The cost to insure your Bitcoin stack against price drops.

   - _Strengths_: Familiar insurance concept with Bitcoin terminology
   - _Weaknesses_: May trigger negative associations with traditional insurance

5. **Volatility Shield** - The cost of protection against Bitcoin price swings.
   - _Strengths_: Descriptive of what you're paying for, positive framing
   - _Weaknesses_: Less Bitcoin-specific, more technical

**UI Implementation Examples:**

- "Protection Sats: 18,000 (just 0.072% of your protected Bitcoin)"
- "Security Investment: $9.18 (Less than 0.1% of protected value)"
- "Stack Insurance: 18,000 sats for full 30-day coverage"
- "Volatility Shield: 18,000 sats protects against 10% price drops"

### 5. Moneyness (ITM/ATM/OTM) → Protection Strategy

**Current Challenge:**
Concepts like "in-the-money" (ITM), "at-the-money" (ATM), and "out-of-the-money" (OTM) are highly abstract and technical.

   - _HODL-Safe_ (ITM): Maximum protection that begins immediately
   - _Current Value Guard_ (ATM): Protection at today's exact price

   - _Standard Protection_ (ATM): Current price protection
   - _Basic Protection_ (OTM): Major drop protection

4. **Value Defense Plans** - Protection plans based on when they activate.

   - _Immediate Defense_ (ITM): Protection active right away
   - _Current Value Defense_ (ATM): Activates at today's price
   - _Drop Defense_ (OTM): Activates during significant price falls
   - _Strengths_: Clear activation points, defensive framing
   - _Weaknesses_: Less Bitcoin-specific

5. **Stack Protection Modes** - Different modes of protecting your Bitcoin stack.
   - _Preemptive Mode_ (ITM): Protection before any drop occurs
   - _Market-Match Mode_ (ATM): Protection matching current market price
   - _Deep-Drop Mode_ (OTM): Protection against severe market downturns
   - _Strengths_: Technical-feeling without being financial jargon
   - _Weaknesses_: "Mode" might feel abstract

**UI Implementation Examples:**

- "Select your Bitcoin Shield Type based on your protection needs"
- "Choose from three Protection Tiers: Premium, Standard, or Basic"
- "Which HODL Strategy matches your Bitcoin outlook?"
- "Select your Value Defense Plan: Immediate, Current, or Drop"

### 6. Exercise Process → Activation Process

**Current Challenge:**
"Exercise" is options jargon disconnected from protection thinking, while "activation" still feels mechanical.

**5 Bitcoin-Native Alternatives:**

   - _Weaknesses_: Potentially too informal, may become dated

5. **Value Lock-In** - The process of locking in your protected Bitcoin value.
   - _Strengths_: Clear metaphor, communicates preserving value
   - _Weaknesses_: Could be confused with staking or locking Bitcoin

**UI Implementation Examples:**

- "Initiate HODL Rescue to secure your protected Bitcoin value"
- "Value Capture now available: Lock in your protected price of $43,650"
- "File a Protection Claim to secure your protected Bitcoin value"
