# The Bitcoin Insurance Company: Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Updated

## Introduction

The Bitcoin Insurance Company is a decentralized application built on the Stacks blockchain that helps everyday Bitcoin users protect the value of their Bitcoin holdings against market volatility. While traditional hedging tools like options contracts exist, they remain inaccessible to regular users due to complex financial jargon and intimidating interfaces. The Bitcoin Insurance Company solves this problem by transforming options contracts into simple, understandable "Bitcoin protection policies" that function like familiar insurance products.

This PRD outlines a complete Bitcoin Protection Center focused on our primary persona "Protective Peter" - an everyday Bitcoin user who wants security against price drops without needing to understand complex trading terminology.
