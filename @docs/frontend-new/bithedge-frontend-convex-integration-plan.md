# BitHedge Frontend: Convex & Wallet Integration Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for integrating the BitHedge React frontend with the Convex backend and existing Stacks wallet providers (Hiro, Devnet). The goal is to replace the current placeholder UI (`CampaignDetails.tsx`) with the core BitHedge components (`Protection Center`, `Account Dashboard`, etc.) while preserving and adapting the essential wallet connection and transaction signing logic. This plan follows the architecture defined in `@docs/backend-new/bithedge-component-architecture.md` and `@docs/backend-new/convex-backend-implementation.md`.

### Area 4: Code Cleanup & Refinement

**Goal**: Remove obsolete code from the template project and ensure the new structure is clean and maintainable.

## 5. Implementation Strategy (Phased Rollout)

The implementation will follow the sequence of the areas defined above:

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation (Area 1)**: Ensure Convex and wallets are integrated and communicating correctly. This is the bedrock for all subsequent work.
2.  **Phase 2: Read Path (Area 2)**: Implement a feature that primarily reads data from Convex via the user's wallet identity. This validates the data fetching pipeline.
3.  **Phase 3: Write Path (Area 3)**: Implement a feature that requires preparing data, interacting with Convex mutations, and signing/submitting blockchain transactions. This validates the core action-taking pipeline.
4.  **Phase 4: Cleanup (Area 4)**: Remove dead code and refactor key components like the transaction hook for maintainability.

This phased approach allows for incremental validation of the core architecture and interaction patterns.

## 6. Key Dependencies

- **Convex Backend**: Successful completion of relevant Convex backend functions and actions as outlined in `@docs/backend-new/convex-backend-implementation.md` (e.g., `api.policies.getUserPolicies`, `api.premium.calculatePremium`, `api.policies.preparePolicyCreation`, `api.policies.recordPendingPolicy`). Tasks in this plan may be blocked if corresponding backend functionality is not ready.
- **Existing Wallet Components**: Relies on the presence and basic functionality of `HiroWalletProvider.tsx`, `DevnetWalletProvider.tsx`, `ConnectWallet.tsx`, `DevnetWalletButton.tsx`.
- **UX Specifications**: UI implementation tasks (WFI-302) depend on finalized UX designs/specifications like `@docs/frontend-new/bithedge-protection-center-streamlined-ux-spec.md`.

## 7. Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to migrating the frontend from the initial template structure to a functional BitHedge application integrated with Convex and Stacks wallets. By breaking down the work into distinct areas and tasks, we can track progress effectively and ensure all necessary components are built and integrated correctly, preserving the critical wallet interaction logic while implementing the target BitHedge UI and features.
